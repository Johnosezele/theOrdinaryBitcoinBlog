We are live on: https://ordinarybitcoinblog.vercel.app/

**Making Bitcoin simple, social, and seriously fun.**

The **Ordinary Bitcoin Blog** transforms complex Bitcoin topics into friendly, visual, and interactive stories. Through playful conversations between cartoon friends Carol and Bob, each blog entry (called an **Issue**)<Renamed to story> breaks down key concepts in a way that's easy to understand, visually rich, and fun to share.

> Like chatting with a friend, but about Bitcoin. And with cartoon characters of Bob and Carol.

## What We're Building

We're creating a **learning platform** that feels more like a comic strip meets Duolingo. Every "Issue" features:

-  **Conversational Lessons**: Bite-sized Bitcoin topics delivered through fun dialogues.
-  **Vibrant Visuals**: Cartoon characters, playful animations, and illustrations.
-  **Interactive Quizzes**: Score-based quizzes to test knowledge and share results on social media.
